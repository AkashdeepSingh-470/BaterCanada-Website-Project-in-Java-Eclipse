Project 
 	 
Description: 
 
Create a simulation of a banking system that allows the user to create bank accounts for clients, and allow them to do some bank transactions.  
The client can have multiple accounts with different types and the clients should be able to: 
1.	Display their current balance 
2.	Deposit money  
3.	Draw money and (charge a fee)
4.	Transfer money to other accounts within the bank 
5.	Pay utility bills  
6.	Other transactions you would like to add. 
But, once the clients’ accounts created must be saved in a text file, so we don't need to enter their data anymore. But the system must be able to change their data if needed. 
Always when the user wants to use the system must get a menu to choose the required option, and maybe after choosing the menu there is a sub-menu popup.  
 
The system can do the following: 
1.	Let the user create accounts in different types 
2.	Let the user enter details about the clients and accounts according to the account type 
3.	Save all the details in a file. 
4.	Let the user be able to read and change the details 
5.	Let the user be able to perform the above transactions 
6.	Any other tasks you would like to add Note:  
●	There are different types of bank accounts, you should google it to know more  
●	You can’t use array you have to use ArrayList, so the number of clients or accounts is flexible.  
●	If you find you need further details or you have any questions about the system which are not mentioned here in the description, then you should answer by your selves.  
●	The description here is giving you the minimum requirements, only.  
 	 
How to submit 
●	Check on Moodle
●	You will work within your groups.  
●	You must create a system report.pdf as a word then save as a PDF file that has: 
○ Cover page showing your names and id’s 
○ Index (table of contact) 
○ Introduction a brief about the system 
○ Full description of the system including the minimum requirements you have up at the above description 
○ Explain the classes with their attributes and methods (not code)  
○ Explain exactly what the system can do (all tasks) 
○ Explain how the system is working like you are creating a user manual 
○ The source code of all the system 
○ Some screenshots showing the errors or exceptions you get while you are testing the system, and explain how you could solve them. 
○ Some screenshots showing the system is working without errors 
○ Name(s) of the file(s) the system is creating, and copy of their details  
○ Conclusion 5min video from each member: explain how you created the system, what did you do to collect more information and details about banking systems and different types of accounts. Explain the challenges you faced and how you could defeat them. Explain how you distribute the work among you, so explain what exactly each group member has done. 
○ List of references
